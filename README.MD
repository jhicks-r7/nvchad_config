#  My NVCHAD Configuration
This is the configuration I currently use for NVCHAD. I have a small amount of customization that I have not documented whatsoever.

I likely did things very "wrong" or outside the accepted norms because I am still learning and have barely any idea what I'm doing I just primarily try to make things work
